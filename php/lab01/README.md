## matrix multiplication

Our separate pieces were janky and I needed some practice so I just rewrote the whole thing. Add your names to each of the files and put them in your class google drive, maybe we can still get the points.

####notes
+ keep app.php, defaults.php, and fileIO.php in the same directory
+ don't bother making the data files, app will check for them on launch and create them if they're missing
+ if you're using xampp or whatever don't forget to update your file permissions
+ If you feel strongly about adding css, feel free to do so :)
